## MLOps: What is it and how it differs from DevOps or DataOps?
### Introduction
In this era of digital transformation, it is widely known that those organizations who are able to successfully leverage AI & ML in their business decisions will have a competitive advantage over their competitors. <br> 
Noting that reliable research firms have reported statistics such as: <br>
*“Through 2022, only 20% of analytic insights will deliver business outcomes.”* - Gartner <br>
*“Why do 87% of data science projects never make it into production?”* - VentureBeat AI <br>
there are clearly many barriers that exist in order to efficiently use AI & ML. One concept that aims to solve these problems and improve those statistics is Machine Learning Operations, commonly known as MLOps. It is a process that provides the necessary agility to allow for increased scaling of AI initiatives in enterprises.
### Background
Knowledge of machine learning or the data science project lifecycle is helpful for understanding the differentiating aspects of the three forms of operationalization but not absolutely necessary. <br>

Simply defined, an AI project life cycle starts with a discussion between the business unit (subject matter experts) and the data team 
(typically involving data scientist, data engineer, and IT). Once a business goal has been defined, the focus then shifts to understanding 
what data would help answer this question and pulling that data from various sources (internal, census, public, etc.). 
Once collecting the data, it needs to be cleaned and pass through a designed data pipeline architecture. 
After data analysis and feature engineering a model is then trained and built. Once the model reaches an accepted level of performance, 
it is then deployed into production, either through a web application or the company’s internal apps. 
Then comes the agile methodology of iterating to ensure the model is still performing and continuously meeting the business’ goal. <br>
Of course, a mere paragraph on the AI life cycle cannot explain the intricacies of each step. 
In fact, the leading enterprises in AI have several job positions that cover just one of these esoteric steps. 
This preceding paragraph aims to provide simple background for what the ML operations entails. 
MLOps does not apply to just one of these steps, it is an underlying process that is ingrained throughout the duration of the cycle. By standardizing and streamlining the management surrounding this life cycle, companies are able to deploy models faster and ensure that once in production, 
they continue meet performance and add value. It is important to note that ML projects, while cumbersome on their own, are part of a larger project 
that involves a business decision surrounding technology, processes and people. (Treveil)
### What is DevOps?
DevOps is the process by which software engineers create software and then deploy said software into production. The production aspect being the operation component, or in other words, how you operate the software. The cycle includes writing the code, as well as continuously testing, deploying and then monitoring the software once it is in production. The development of the DevOps system 20+ years ago has helped engineers decrease the development life cycle from timeframes of months-years to days-weeks. It is this sort of empirically proven success that MLOps aims to replicate for data science.

While both MLOps and DevOps focus on the continuous delivery of software/ML models, as well as the needed organizational change for collaboration between the various teams involved, there is a key difference that makes ML operations much more difficult to implement. In DevOps one only has to manage code. In MLOps you have to worry about the code of the machine learning model as well as the data from which that model was trained on. As the data flows through a pipeline from its source to to the point where the model is trained, this entire end-to-end process must be maintained and monitored.

Another difference between these two operationalization methods is the way in which the code is built. In software engineering (DevOps), the code is built through an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which sits on top of Git, enabling version control. While in machine learning engineering (MLOps) the code is often initially built in hyper-stateful notebook environments that are great for prototyping and interactive data interrogation and development but are difficult to version control effectively. Being able to quickly resort back to an earlier version of code is fundamental for streamlining the development of any coding project. MLOps helps build processes around this.  
### What is DataOps?
DataOps shares the same principles as DevOps, a process for value delivery and quality assurance, except it replaces software with data. It continues to emphasize the collaboration between the multiple teams that work to collect, store, analyze, secure and deliver data. DataOps allows for streamlining of big data projects to provide reliable access and quicker analysis. One way to ensure reliability is through using distributed storage to ensure high availability and scalability. StreamSets is an example of a tool that does just that through its use of Spark at a higher abstraction. By taking low level code written in Java (code for cluster-based storage) and converting it into a GUI (graphical user interface), StreamSets allows for quicker and reliable data pipeline architecture construction. StreamSets is a leader in DataOps software and a tool that Axis Group specializes in as well.
If you’ve picked up by now that there is need for DataOps inside the MLOps process then congratulations, because there certainly is! Since the model is a function of the data it is trained on, it is necessary to maintain the integrity of this data from beginning to end. The concept of data drift, or the unexpected alteration of your data, can cause serious problems. Without proper DataOps it could mean failure for your entire ML model. 
### MLOps
Another concept of drift or decay in this process comes from your actual model in production. Over time issues can arise, such as evolving data profiles which affect the accuracy of your predictions. Model drift provides the necessary process of continuously monitoring and auditing to confirm that your production models remain stable are accurate . The automation of this monitoring is one example of implementing MLOps processes into your life cycle. Axis Group has recently helped a large financial services company with this use-case using python and which improved their model evaluation timeline from two weeks to just minutes.
Machine learning models are increasingly being deployed into high impact scenarios; for example, a machine learning algorithm is making a prediction as to whether a certain person (based on many variables) will default on a loan or not. These sorts of decisions are life changing for an individual and making sure the algorithm responds fairly to this request is a responsibility of the data science team up to the CEO. This accountability is already being seen in highly regulated industries like finance and tech and is stretching to other sectors as well.  By implementing MLOps into your environments you are able to knowingly meet and prove your are meeting these regulatory standards while reaping many of the positive benefits mentioned throughout the article. 
### Conclusion
This article aims to provide a high-level overview on what MLOps is exactly, as well as comparing it to other known operationalization processes in the data analytics world. Due to its nature as a relatively nascent topic, MLOps is continually being improved upon with the goal of enabling enterprises to scale their AI initiatives. AI/ML software, like Dataiku, are working to solve these problems through increased documentation and collaboration between users on their platform.
